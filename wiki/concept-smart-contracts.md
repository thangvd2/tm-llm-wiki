# Smart Contracts

Smart Contracts in Vault Core encapsulate the business logic of a customer account. They represent the terms and conditions of a product and contain the logic to accept or reject postings.

## Parameterisation

Smart contracts can represent a wide range of product behaviors using parameterisation. Parameters allow a single contract to encapsulate accounts with shared but customizable functionality (e.g., an interest-only vs. capital repayment mortgage).

Parameters have a time-series representation and can be defined at multiple levels:
- **Global**: Single global value (e.g., Bank of England base rate).
- **Template**: Set across all contracts of a specific type.
- **Instance**: Specific to a single customer's account.

## Hooks and Lifecycle

Hooks are used to define the logic executed when a certain event occurs during the lifecycle of an account. The typical account lifecycle progresses through four key phases: **Activation → Operational → Maintenance → Closure**.

> **Diagram Summary**: The hook lifecycle visualizes the journey from "Opening account" to "Closing account". During the "Live account" phase (Operational and Maintenance), various event hooks (e.g., pre-posting, scheduled events, parameter changes) can occur in any order and execute multiple times, while activation and deactivation hooks happen strictly at the boundaries of the lifecycle.

Key hooks include:
- **Activation**: Called before activation to schedule definitions and perform initial movements.
- **Pre-posting**: Evaluates whether to accept or reject an incoming posting.
- **Post-posting**: Runs after a posting is accepted, potentially generating additional movements or events.
- **Scheduled event**: Runs at defined frequencies (e.g., interest accruals, fee applications).
- **Conversion**: Handles converting the account to a new product version.
- **Pre/Post-parameter**: Runs when instance parameters are updated to validate or execute required actions.
- **Derived parameters**: Computes values when requested.
- **Deactivation**: Actions run during account closure.

## Schedules

Schedules execute operations on a regular cadence, such as daily interest calculations or monthly fee applications. The initial schedule cadence is defined at contract activation but can be altered throughout the account's life.
